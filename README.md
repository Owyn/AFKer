# AFKer
A tera-proxy module that blocks you from getting back to the character select screen after you haven't moved for more than an hour. 
This prevents server's AFK check from kicking you out of the game.  
  
## Usage
The script is enabled by default and will prevent you from getting logged out when you are standing still for an hour. Use !afk command to disable it
Simply moving your character will make you able to go back to character selection and reset the 1 hour timer.
